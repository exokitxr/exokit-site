## Overview

The earliest records of “reality tabs” are from an issue from March and a tweet from April 2018:

In many ways, Reality Tabs is the natural progression from current web browser tabs:

Reality Tabs **ARE**:  
* seperate user windows   
* web pages running in parallel   
* occupying the same 3d space   
* highly performant and optimized to run in parallel   


Reality Tabs **ARE NOT**:  
* intrinsically interactive   


## Reality Tab Use Cases

Reality Tabs open a world of possibilites for creative use cases.

You can use Reality Tabs for:  
* multiple 3d XR sites running in parallel   
* seperate XR sites communicating with eachother  
* multiple XR sites running in the same 3d space   
* XR bots that are constantly running  
* much more, be creative!  


## Technical Explanation 

Reality Tabs are seperate user windows. Each Reality Tab renders at the same time in their own context before being composited into the display/headset/what have you. [Previously this was done synchornously](https://github.com/webmixedreality/exokit/pull/760), one window at a time, switching GL contexts to the correct one.
